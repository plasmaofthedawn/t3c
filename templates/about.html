<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p class="bold">Why on earth did you make this?</p>
<p>I had a lot of spare time due to quarantine, so here I am I guess.</p>
<br/>
<p class="bold">Where did you find this video?</p>
<p>Youtube recommended it to me, same as most others.</p>
<br/>
<p class="bold">I hate this site. Where can I send death threats to?</p>
<p>You can gladly send them to iamawesomeuknow99@gmail.com, though death threats (and any other kind of mail) will probably be ignored.</p>
<br/>
<p class="bold">This video is cool! Can I share it (or this site) with my friends?</p>
<p>It's not really up to me. Some people see the people who know about this video as a kind of "secret society" and wouldn't want it to be spread, but I personally don't mind it.</p>
<br/>
<p class="bold">I want to add a checkpoint/comment/offensive statement to this website!</p>
<p>The original video is down, so unless I decide to add more videos, you can't.</p>
<p>There are other places for you to leave checkpoints all over youtube, so you can do it there if you want. </p>
<br/>
<p class="bold">Where did "t3c" come from?</p>
<p>t3c originally came from me copy-pasting the title into Google translate. It gave me "Thorn Thorn Tail Color", which I made into an acronym. It stuck with me, so I used it for this.</p>
